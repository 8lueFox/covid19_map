Actually library 'leaflet' in newest version have a problems with development version, but in production its work correctly. Idk why... I will soon check this again and commit package's config. 

You can check out my app in link: https://60c5f2460fdc7e79d6313c6e--elegant-clarke-c9ddf3.netlify.app. But please, do not click on map too much. Free version of opencagedata.com api have limited request count.

If u want to check this just download source and in catalog '/web' start commend 'npm install' and next 'npm start'.
